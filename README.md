Deployment of Docker Datacenter
-------------------------------

This playbook setup a cluster of Ubuntu (14.04) hosts running
* Docker Engine CS
* Universal Control Plane
* Docker Trusted Registry

Inventory
---------

The inventory.ini file defines the host the server needs to be deployed on

The following example of inventory.ini file defines:
- 3 UCP controller (the main manager is identified with ucp_manager=1, the replicas are identified with ucp_replica=1)
- 3 UCP workers
- 3 DTR manager (the main manager is identified with dtr_manager=1, the replicas are identified with dtr_replica=1)

```
[ucp_managers]
192.168.0.230 ucp_manager=1
192.168.0.231 ucp_replica=1
192.168.0.232 ucp_replica=1

[ucp_workers]
192.168.0.233 dtr_manager=1
192.168.0.234 dtr_replica=1
192.168.0.235 dtr_replica=1

[ucp:children]
ucp_managers
ucp_workers

[dtr:children]
ucp_workers

[dtr:vars]
replica_id=13b873dfa912
```

Notes:
- the nodes are structured in groups. Only the IP addresses within the ucp_managers and ucp_workers needs to be set.
- the replica_id within the dtr:vars group is a random value that is used to setup DTR, you can leave it or pick another one.


Nodes creation
--------------

Several quick ways to create the nodes:

### Vagrant

A simple Vagrant file is provided in this repo.

```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.provision "shell", inline: "echo Hello"

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
      v.memory = 2048
      v.cpus = 1
  end

  nodes_number = 3
  (1..nodes_number).each do |i|
    hostname = "ucp#{i}"
    config.vm.define hostname do |ucp|
      ucp.vm.hostname = hostname
      ucp.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
      ucp.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
    end
  end
end
```

Change the nodes_number and run ```vagrant up```
Once the machine created, get their IP address and add them in the inventory file.

### Terraform (on DigitalOcean)

A simple ucp.tf file is provided

```
variable "do_token" {}

# Configure the DigitalOcean Provider
provider "digitalocean" {
    token = "${var.do_token}"
}

# Create a web server
resource "digitalocean_droplet" "ucp" {
    count = "2"
    image = "ubuntu-14-04-x64"
    name = "ucp-${count.index+1}"
    region = "lon1"
    size = "2gb"
    ssh_keys = ["FINGER_PRINTS_OR_IDS_OF_YOUR_SSH_KEY"]
}
```

Modification that needs to be done:

- change the *count* to specify the number of node needed (total number of nodes of the ucp cluster)
- change the ssh_keys so it uses the list of the fingerprints of your keys (eg: ssh_keys = ["e9:39:8c:f0:ae:6e:c6:e2:61:31:12:83:17:6e:fd:f3"])
- run the following command using you DigitalOcean token:``` terraform apply -var="do_token=<DO_TOKEN>" ```

Note: you can of course modify the other arguments to better match your needs.

A *terraform.tfstate* file will be created, pick the IP addresses of the nodes and add them to the inventory file.

### Your way

The option above are only 2 simple and very limited ways to get you started, of course you can select other options and cloud providers.

Running options
---------------

Several possible cases depending upon the way the nodes are created:

* Vagrant VM are used for test => **vagrant** user needs to be used

  ```ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -k -u vagrant -s main.yml```

Note: vagrant ssh password requested (sudo password not requested as vagrant user is authorized to sudo without password)

* root access is provided => **root** user needs to be used

  ```ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -k -u root main.yml```

Note: root ssh password will be requested

* another user provided with sudo right and a password needed to issue sudo commands

  ```ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -k -K -u USER -s main.yml```

Note: both user's ssh password + sudo password will be requested

* user provided with a ssh key added to its authorized_keys

   ```ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -u USER --private-key PATH_TO_KEY -s main.yml```

Note: this option is usefull in the case where a ssh key is used when creating the host (AWS, DO, ...)

Split the installation
----------------------

In order to monitor the installation process, the commands can be splitted in 3 using tags:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -t engine [OPTS] main.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -t ucp [OPTS] main.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -t dtr [OPTS] main.yml
```

Using the application
---------------------

Once installed, the application can be access on the following URLs

Application | URL | Comments
------------| --- | --------
UCP         | https://ucp[0] | admin / ucppassword
DTR         | https://dtr[0] |

Disclaimer
----------

This playbook is dedicated to have Docker Datacenter up and running, in HA mode, within a matter of minutes.
This playbook should not be used as it is for production setup though.
